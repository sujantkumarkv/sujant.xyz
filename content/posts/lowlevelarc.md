so i've been thinking to dive into lowlevel like cpu, alu, logic gates & transistors level depth ever since i heard george hotz speaking on how its a skill which is fading & its hard to hire bcz lots of people don't *truly* understand how computers *actually* work. i understood what he meant and i needed to do this. computers are honestly just spiritually magic in a sense of how we infuse sand(chips) with intelligence(computation) and cast spells(code) and it just works.
