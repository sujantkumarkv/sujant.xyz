I hereby introduce, "Sujant's Law of Middle Reality"

It says that,
"Whether in extremes or normalcy, perceived or portrayed future realities is skewed and the truth lies in the garb of the middle reality such that even if the extreme were to be true, societies evolve accordingly and it shifts the reality of the middle reality."

It stems from my observations of situations, actions & results unfolding over periods of time in history of human societies in all forms. Because biologically humans are community driven, common patterns of situations and results show up. People underestimating & overestimating things is a key crucial axis of this law or rather, a view of reality. We had the first financial bubble as the Tulips bubble and it was believed people collectively have learnt to deal with it and we likely won't have it again, can't be much further from truth.

The law is also visible in emerging of new technologies where there's often an overestimation and underestimation from two kinds of groups. And this has happen often in history with evidence, whether in times of upcoming cars replacing horses or now AI replacing humans.
