late update but lagllama + encoder-decoder model is done.

- 03apr24

have to complete the time-series-transformers project (also, college's major project) which includes multivariate data: streamflow, rainfall, temperature etc. i've been procrastinating it on forever & my friend did his part of LSTM, i gotta ship something by end of today. i've a hf's decoder probabilistic one but damn its dataset cleaning has been tough, also i've an encoder-decoder in mind, spatio-temporal transformer's "Long transformer paper" i read much much earlier and yeah, a latest foundation lagllama model (gotta finetune).

by today gotta do the: probablistic decoder + encoder-decoder.

life is all a game of endurance, always has been. i'm thinking of getting this published in a Q1, now i've the support of a great prof, let's not waste this.
